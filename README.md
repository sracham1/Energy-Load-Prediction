# Energy-Load-Prediction

The project is a joint project designed for students to apply marketing concepts and analytical techniques taught in class to a real-life marketing problem. The dataset obtained for this project is from DOE. It contains 10 years of hourly energy consumption data from PJM in Megawatts. This project is a time series analysis on the power consumption of the different electric companies. Each company has a different duration of available data; therefore, the analysis constitutes multiple time series models for each region (i.e. Power company). This project demonstrates how Power consumption is closely tied to climatic conditions and global warming. It shows how seasonal patterns are associated with variation in Power consumption. The forecasts conducted are aimed to provide a meaningful insight to PJM and towards its future prospects in the field of Marketing Analytics.

## Models considered: ETS, Auto Arima, Prophet, Opera and NNAR
